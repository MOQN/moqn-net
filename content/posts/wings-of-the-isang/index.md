## Interactive Media + Live Performance with Wings of the Isang

- **Performance**: 'In a Moment and Eternity', Chang-dong Platform 61, Seoul, Korea | Jan 19, 2019
- **Development**: Since 2016
- **Event**: Interactive Media Live Concert
- **Roles**: Art Direction, Visual Art & Creative Coding, Intermedia Operation Direction

Sponsored by Seoul City, a large-scale live concert was developed. Instead of a typical performance playing a music video, interaction technology and cutting-edge media were implemented. Not only were pre-made high-quality visuals controlled, but visuals like _Void Circle_ ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_lFPT48_I)) were drawn in real-time using a custom-built programming system. Additional videos can be found here: [2016 Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSIzOgCcEvNwW_z5NVbH_PdxsjCIJzz4d) | [2017 Performance](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSIzOgCcEvNzATRPGeZOn5UitQqi80XpG)
