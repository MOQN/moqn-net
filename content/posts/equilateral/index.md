Equilateral is made up of two componentsâ€”movement (dance) and light (projection) and treats the body as a canvas, with all audio-visual elements becoming one with the performer.<br>
The performance uses a unique front-of-house set in the shape of a triangle. At each angle is an entirely networked media hub gathering precise, 3D motion tracking data and outputting a real-time response.<br>
Additionally, I aim to contribute a template, or guidebook, for how this technical setup can be appropriated for other live performances. The conceptual framework of the equilateral triangle translates to a perfect setting for a diverse range of interactive capabilities.
