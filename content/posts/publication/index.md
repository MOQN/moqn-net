## Publication

Moon, J., Hargis, J. & Lu, H. (January 2021). [Differences, limitations and advantages of effective online and face-to-face teaching methods for a Media Arts course](https://www.tojned.net/journals/tojned/articles/v11i01/v11i01-02.pdf). _The Online Journal of New Horizons in Education_, 11(1).

### Note:

- During a sudden migration from F2F to online teaching and learning due to the outbreak of the COVID-19, Dr. Jace Hargis (inaugural NYU Shanghai CTL Director) and I discussed online teaching experiences and identified transferable teaching and learning activities. Based on the findings and our reflection, we researched and published an article to reflect such learning experience.
- There have been hindrances and limitations in online teaching and learning, but also a number of advantages and potentials were found.
- I believe that the alternatives were to expand our teaching and learning methods with newly adjusted online activities and techniques. Most are transferable and can be blended into the foundational F2F teaching and learning methods.
