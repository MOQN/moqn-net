### Description:

The workshop explored improvisational and experimental painting methods using body motions and media technologies within the themes of "Breaking," "Reconstruction," and "Transformation." It invited artists across diverse disciplines including dance, music, theatre, architecture, lighting, and more.

The drawing application and motion tracking system developed for the workshop allowed participants to manipulate visual effects without prior knowledge. Participants, primarily dancers, adapted their movements to create improvisational art pieces.
