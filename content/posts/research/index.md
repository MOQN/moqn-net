## ![Future (Assumption)](image/chart3_future.png)

### Future (Assumption)

- **Devices**:
  - Cellphones will be combined with smartwatches.
  - They will function as personal network routers connecting to almost every electronic device (e.g., wearable devices, tablets, computers, cars, and home appliances).
  - Personal computers may evolve into hybrid tablet-laptop devices like the 'Surface.'
  - More wearable devices will be developed.
- **User Interface**:
  - Simpler and more convenient.
  - Smaller designs for wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches, smart glasses).

#### Questions:

- With smaller display interfaces, how will users write text messages?  
  Finger-writing? Voice or word recognition?
- Will text messages be replaced by walkie-talkie-style conversations?

### New Way to Write

**I might want to experiment and explore various ways to write text messages on smaller interfaces.**  
These are the first attempts:

### Idea to Improve Based on Spritz

#### Spritzing:

Spritz presents reading content with the **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** located at the specific place where youâ€™re already looking. This allows you to read without moving your eyes.
